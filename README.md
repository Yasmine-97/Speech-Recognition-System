# Speech-Recognition-System
This project is part of my Human Data Analytics and Machine Learning class to perform a classification task of spoken keywords using deep learning approaches. 
You can find the miniaturized python code used in the kaggle environment with python ( Tensorflow framework). 
Two main architectures were used in this project: The first in a Convolutional Neural Network and the second is a Recurrent Neural Network + CNN ( More specifically an LSTM architecture).
